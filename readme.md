# Vargr table

A client centric websocket service that lets the clients put anything on a shared table.

It is inspired by redux and my desire to make some browserbased multiplayer games.

This is mostly an experiment, and i would not recommend using it for anything serius.
In fact i might scrap this, or change the nature entirely once i have done a MVP
or played more around with the spec for the GrapQL websocket stuff more..
