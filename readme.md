# Vargr table

*Warning, this is alpha code!*
*Interfaces and functionality might change a lot in each version.*

A client centric websocket service that lets the clients put anything on a shared websocket 'table'.

It is inspired by redux, and my desire to rapidly prototype browserbased multiplayer games.


# Todo
* Scopes, server-private scopes
* Private actions, add "public:set", "public:set:all" etc.
* Multiple reducers?
